# pellucid_olivero
Theme for Bradford Abbas Parish Council website

## Approach 

### CSS directory

We're using as much of the standard `olivero` theme as we can and have overridden the CSS as little as we can.

-  `swiftmail.css` is for styling the newsletters

-  `print.css` is for styling Agendas, Meetings and Minutes for the noticeboard etc.  

-  `pellucid.css` overrides the core standard `olivero` theme
